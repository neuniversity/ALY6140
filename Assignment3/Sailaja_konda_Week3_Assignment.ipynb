This data set consists of employee names, salary details and total compensation details of the employees from 2011 to 2017. The data present in 2017 data set differs from remaining years. Using this data set we can differentiate the employees based on their salary, educational profile.Then it is easy to find The highest paid and lowest paid employees. The salaries for employees based on the areas (postal column in the data set) are separated to know in which area the employees were paid more and in which areas they were paid less. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Crime Incident Report consists of data related to crimes that took place in Boston from 2015 to-date. It also consists of the type of the incident and the place of the crime happened. With this data the total crimes took place in a particular year in a particular region can be calculated. The distribution can be obtained for the crime count in a particular year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Economic Indicators data set consists of variety of economic data related to employment, housing, travel and real estate development. It contains total jobs and unemployment rate related to employment, housing sales and housing price related to housing, flight available and passengers related to travel. Each and every column in this data set is comparable with another related column and we can draw correlations. The analysis of economic performance and future predictionas are possible with this data set.\n"
